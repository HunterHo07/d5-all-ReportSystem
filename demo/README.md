# Project Reporting System Demo

This directory contains a standalone demo of the Project Reporting System. The demo showcases the user interface and core functionality without requiring the full tech stack.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Visual Design**: Modern, clean interface with attention to detail
- **Animation Effects**: GSAP animations for smooth transitions and visual appeal
- **Scoring System**: Visual representation of the standardized scoring system
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Running the Demo

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the demo. No server or build process is required.

```bash
# From the project root
cd demo
# Open index.html in your browser
```

## Design Elements

The demo incorporates several advanced design elements:

1. **Animated Particles**: Subtle floating particles in the hero section create visual interest
2. **Scroll Animations**: Elements animate into view as the user scrolls down the page
3. **Interactive Score Cards**: Visual representation of the scoring system
4. **Micro-interactions**: Subtle hover effects and transitions throughout

## "Surprise Me" Elements

The demo includes several unexpected design elements:

1. **Floating Particles**: Random particles with varying opacity and size that float around in the hero section
2. **Staggered Animations**: Cards and elements appear with a pleasing staggered timing
3. **Score Visualization**: Color-coded score indicators that provide immediate visual feedback

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5/CSS3**: Modern markup and styling
- **GSAP**: For advanced animations and transitions
- **Lottie**: For vector animations
- **Modern CSS**: Flexbox, Grid, and CSS Variables

## Next Steps

After reviewing the demo, proceed to the full implementation using our tech stack:

1. SvelteKit for the frontend
2. EncoreGo for the backend
3. Pocketbase for the database
4. Shadcn-Svelte for UI components

The full implementation will maintain the visual design and animations demonstrated here while adding full functionality and data persistence.
